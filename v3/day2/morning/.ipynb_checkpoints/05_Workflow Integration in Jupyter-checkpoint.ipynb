    "Research projects are often involve complex processes with multiple steps that are interconnected. \n",
    "Each of these steps might focus on a specific part of the analysis, such as data cleaning, model building, or visualization.\n",
    "While these steps can be developed and run separately, they are usually not independent; one step may depend on the outcome of a previous step.\n",
    "For instance, before you can build a model, you might need results from data preprocessing or specific configuration settings.\n",

    "In Jupyter notebooks, there are various scenarios where one notebook might need to use content from another notebook.\n",
    "Sometimes, you might want to run an entire notebook to make sure everything works in sequence.\n",
    "At other times, you may only need to pull in specific parts of another notebook, such as a function, a configuration setting, or a block of code.\n",
    "Jupyter provides several built-in and external tools to handle these scenarios efficiently.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use these tools to manage complex workflows such that notebooks can either run entire sequences or access just the specific content they need, making the research process more efficient and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by looking at magic commands to manage notebooks, how to sequence of notebooks from another notebook, how to import contents of notebook like it was a script, and end by practicing setting up a configuration notebook. "
