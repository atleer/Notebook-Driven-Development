# Project: Parameterize an existing notebook

Split and parameterize `analysis.ipynb` into logically separate notebooks such that you get same results when you run them sequentially with `papermill`.

(To be filled during meeting with Nick)

- [ ] Continuous feedback on their attempt to apply their knowledge
- [ ] They should be able to share learnings and demonstrate how these learnings came about in their application attempts
- [ ] They should be open-ended and complex
- [ ] It should be easy to get started (not much reading, a clear objective, a clear way to select the tools and where to apply them)
- [ ] The project and materials should be specific to the topics trying to be learned
- [ ] Resources should be given/highlighted for further information

Application:
1. executing notebook with `!papermill`
2. paramters tag
3. `!papermill`
4. passing parameters
5. examining notebooks with errors
6. sequential running of notebooks with `!papermill`
