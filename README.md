Comments and Feedback to Myself

1. Rethink day 1 morning session project idea: I think it should be another notebook. Writing it as a project when it can clearly be a notebook is not the right idea (make exercise cells to export, exercise cells to change slide tag type etc). **Come back when all notebooks are done**
2. Day 1 afternoonsession (interactive notebook). Flow seems off. Same type of plots. Sections can be interactive data table design and implementation, interactive plot design, row and column-wise arrangement design in notebook, complete layout checking and serving
